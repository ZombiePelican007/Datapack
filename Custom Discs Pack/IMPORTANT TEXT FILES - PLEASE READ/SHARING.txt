Q: Can I share this pack around?

A: Via a link to the planetminecraft.com page for this pack, yes. As far as other things like reposting the pack onto a different site, no. I do not allow that.


Q: Can I use this pack as a base for other packs?

A: For all of my other packs I would say no, but due to the nature of this pack, yeah absolutely. It's up to you on whether to give credit to me or not, but in general make whatever music disc pack you want from this.


Q: Why such a strict policy on sharing your work? Aren't they just Minecraft textures?

A: The stuff I do for Minecraft is a sort of set of small passion-projects. I put a lot of heart into these things, so it would suck tremendously to see them get reposted by people who didn't even make them. 
   Imagine, if you will, that you're a painter or a sculptor or whatever you want, and you've decided to work on a small passion project as practice for a bigger project in the future. But, when it's finished, someone else claims that practice work and calls it finished, talks big about how they made it and how much work it took, and ends up getting all the clout for it because they just happen to be better with their words and presentation. And despite all that, they did absolutely none of the work to get there.
   I'll tell you, it doesn't feel great. It's disappointing, sad, and makes you almost want to quit sharing your work outright, or in some cases quit doing art altogether. After all, if all the work you did is just for it to get stolen and used by someone else, just to seem impressive, then why even bother? 
   The more art gets stolen, the more artists suffer as a result. Some might not get the dream jobs they've always wanted, some might go outright bankrupt and have to live on the streets. And in those cases, then there wouldn't be any more art from them at all, and all the beautiful work they've done would simply cease. No artist wants to do that. We do the things we do because we want to share it, get bigger from it, and be the best we can be because of it. But when some other stingy person comes around and ruins it for us, the best option might unfortunately just be to quit. 
   Don't cause artists to lose their passion, is what I'm getting at. You'll be remembered for it by 1 person and 1 person only, and that's exactly who you might guess it to be. Most won't remember who you are if you use other people's things to get big, but that poor artist will probably hate you forever if you do that to them. I know I would.
